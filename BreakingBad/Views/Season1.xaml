					<Paragraph>
						<Run Text="Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher, learns he has terminal lung cancer. Desperate to secure the financial future of his family — his wife Skyler White is pregnant, his son Walter White Jr. has cerebral palsy — the 50-year-old leaves his second job at the car wash and teams up with a former student named Jesse Pinkman to make and sell meth. &quot;You know the business. I know the chemistry,&quot; he tells his new partner, who declares Walt &quot;a damn artist&quot; after sampling the first batch cooked in their Winnebago/mobile-drug-lab."/>

						<Run Text="Jesse takes said sample to Domingo Gallardo &quot;Krazy 8&quot; Molina, cousin to Jesse's recently busted drug-dealing partner Emilio Koyama. Emilio, out on bail and convinced Jesse ratted him out, sets up a double-cross. When a desert rendezvous with all four turns nasty, Walt creates a chemical explosion that leaves Emilio dead and Krazy-8 struggling to survive (&quot;Pilot&quot;)."/>

					<Paragraph>
						<Run Text="Krazy-8 escapes only to have Walt recapture him then lock him to a pole in Jesse's basement. Jesse and Walt then flip a coin to determine who'll dissolve Emilio's body in acid (Jesse's job) and who'll kill Krazy-8 (Walt's job). Skyler, meanwhile, uses *69 to trace a suspicious call from Jesse. When Skyler asks who this is, Walt says that Jesse is his pot dealer."/>

					<Paragraph>
						<Run Text="Skyler visits Jesse to tell him to stop selling her husband marijuana. After she leaves, Jesse gets to work on disincorporating Emilio's body. Because he ignores Walt's specific instructions to use a polyethylene plastic container, opting instead to pour hydrofluoric acid on Emilio in the bathtub, the acid completely eats through the tub, which collapses to the floor below leaving Walt and Jesse with a bloody mess to clean up (&quot;Cat's in the Bag...&quot;)."/>

						<Run Text="At Walt's house, Skyler poses vague questions about marijuana to her sister Marie Schrader, who jumps to the conclusion that they're discussing Walter Jr., despite Skyler's denials. Shortly thereafter, Marie persuades her husband, Hank Schrader, a DEA agent, to scare the boy straight. Marie is breaking the law herself, however, having stolen a pair of shoes from a store where she felt the sales clerk was ignoring her."/>

						<Run Text="In another part of town, Jesse bolts from his house after Walt berates him for divulging personal information to Krazy-8. Walt says they have more work to do, but Jesse begs to differ: &quot;Coin flip is sacred! Your job is waiting for you in the basement.&quot; A heart-to-heart with Walt leaves Krazy-8 confident that Walt will spare him, but when Walt realizes Krazy-8 is conning him, he strangles the dealer. After disposing of the body, Walt gets back home and finally reveals to Skyler that he has cancer (&quot;...and the Bag's in the River&quot;)."/>

Walt returns to face down Tuco, using the identity of &quot;Heisenberg,&quot; deceiving him with what looks like meth, but which is actually fulminated mercury that Walt uses to demolish Tuco's office. &quot;You got balls,&quot; Tuco allows, and they make a deal for more meth (&quot;Crazy Handful of Nothin'&quot;)."/>
